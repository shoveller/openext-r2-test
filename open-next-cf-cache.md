Caching
Caching
Next.js offers multiple ways to improve an application's performance by caching routes and network requests. An application will try to pre-render and cache as much data as possible during build-time to reduce the amount of work required when serving a response to a user.

The cache data are updated using revalidation, either peridiocally or on-demand:

"Time-based revalidation" updates the cache data after the revalidation delay specified by the applications expires
"On-demand revalidation" allows to invalid cache entries with a specific tag (via revalidateTag) or at a given path (via revalidatePath). You can also use res.revalidate in Pages router API route.
The @opennextjs/cloudflare caching supports rely on 3 components:

An Incremental Cache to store the cache data
A Queue to synchronize and deduplicate time-based revalidations
A Tag Cache for On-demand revalidations via revalidateTag and revalidatePath.
You can also enable cache interception, to avoid calling the NextServer and thus loading the javascript associated with the page. It can slightly improve cold start performance for ISR/SSG route on cached routes. As of now, cache interception does not work with PPR and is not enabled by default.

Additionally some components uses the Cache Api to improve the performance of these different components. If you're planning on using On-Demand revalidation, you should also use the Cache Purge component to automatically purge the cache when a page is revalidated.

The adapter provides several implementations for each of those components configured in open-next.config.ts.

This guide provides guidelines for common use cases before detailing all the configuration options.

Everything in this page only concerns SSG/ISR and the data cache, SSR route will work out of the box without any caching config.

Guidelines
Small site using revalidation
You should use the following implementation for a small site:

Incremental Cache: use R2 to store the data
Queue: use a Queue backed by Durable Objects
Tag Cache: D1NextModeTagCache
{
"name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
// ...

"services": [
{
"binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
"service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
},
],

// R2 incremental cache
"r2_buckets": [
{
"binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET",
"bucket_name": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
},
],

// DO Queue
"durable_objects": {
"bindings": [
{
"name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE",
"class_name": "DOQueueHandler",
},
],
},
"migrations": [
{
"tag": "v1",
"new_sqlite_classes": ["DOQueueHandler"],
},
],

// D1 Tag Cache (Next mode)
// This is only required if you use On-demand revalidation
"d1_databases": [
{
"binding": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1",
"database_id": "<DATABASE_ID>",
"database_name": "<DATABASE_NAME>",
},
],
}
Large site using revalidation
For a larger site, you should use the ShardedDOTagCache that can handle a higher load than the D1NextModeTagCache:

{
"name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
// ...

"services": [
{
"binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
"service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
},
],

// R2 incremental cache
"r2_buckets": [
{
"binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET",
"bucket_name": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
},
],

// DO Queue and DO Sharded Tag Cache
"durable_objects": {
"bindings": [
{
"name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE",
"class_name": "DOQueueHandler",
},
// This is only required if you use On-demand revalidation
{
"name": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_DO_SHARDED",
"class_name": "DOShardedTagCache",
},
{
"name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_PURGE",
"class_name": "BucketCachePurge",
},
],
},
"migrations": [
{
"tag": "v1",
"new_sqlite_classes": [
"DOQueueHandler",
// This is only required if you use On-demand revalidation
"DOShardedTagCache",
"BucketCachePurge",
],
},
],
}
SSG site
If your site is static, you do not need a Queue nor a Tag Cache. You can use a read-only Workers Static Assets-based incremental cache for the prerendered routes.

import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import staticAssetsIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/static-assets-incremental-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
incrementalCache: staticAssetsIncrementalCache,
enableCacheInterception: true,
});
Staging
For staging, when your site receives low traffic from a single IP, you can replace the DO queue with a memory queue.

Static Assets Caching
The worker doesn't run in front of static assets, so the headers option of next.config.ts doesn't apply to public files (public) and immutable build files (like _next/static).

By default, Cloudflare Static Assets headers use max-age=0 with must-revalidate, allowing the browser to cache assets but with a revalidation request. This is the same default behavior as the public folder on Next.js.

Next.js also generates immutable files that don't change between builds. Those files will also be served from Static Assets. To match the default cache behavior of immutable assets in Next.js, avoiding unnecessary revalidation requests, add the following header to the public/_headers file:

/_next/static/*
Cache-Control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
There are 3 storage options for the incremental cache:

R2 Object Storage: A cost-effective S3-compatible object storage option for large amounts of unstructured data. Data is stored in a single region, meaning cache interactions may be slower - this can be mitigated with a regional cache.
Workers KV: A fast key value store, it uses Cloudflare's Tiered Cache to increase cache hit rates. When you write cached data to Workers KV, you write to storage that can be read by any Cloudflare location. This means your app can fetch data, cache it in KV, and then subsequent requests anywhere around the world can read from this cache. We do not recommend using KV because it is eventually consistent.
Workers Static Assets: A read-only store for the incremental cache, serving build-time values from Workers Static Assets. Revalidation is not supported with this cache.
1. Create an R2 Bucket
   npx wrangler@latest r2 bucket create <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
2. Add the R2 Bucket and Service Binding to your Worker
   The binding name used in your app's worker is NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET. The service binding should be a self reference to your worker where <WORKER_NAME> is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

The prefix used by the R2 bucket can be configured with the NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_PREFIX environment variable, and defaults to incremental-cache.

// wrangler.jsonc
{
// ...
"name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
"r2_buckets": [
{
"binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET",
"bucket_name": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
},
],
"services": [
{
"binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
"service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
},
],
}
3. Configure the cache
   In your project's OpenNext config, enable the R2 cache.

You can optionally setup a regional cache to use with the R2 incremental cache. This will enable faster retrieval of cache entries and reduce the amount of requests being sent to object storage.

The regional cache has two modes:

short-lived: Responses are re-used for up to a minute.
long-lived: Fetch responses are re-used until revalidated, and ISR/SSG responses are re-used for up to 30 minutes.
Additionally there are options you can use to customize the behavior of the regional cache:

shouldLazilyUpdateOnCacheHit: Instructs the cache to be lazily updated, meaning that when requesting data from the cache, a background request is sent to the R2 bucket to get the latest entry. This is enabled by default for the long-lived mode.
bypassTagCacheOnCacheHit: Instructs the cache not to check the tag cache when there is a regional cache hit. This enables reducing response times. When this option is used you need to make sure that the cache gets correctly purged either by enabling the automatic cache purge or purging the cache manually. Defaults to false.
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import { withRegionalCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/regional-cache";
// ...

// With regional cache enabled:
export default defineCloudflareConfig({
incrementalCache: withRegionalCache(r2IncrementalCache, {
mode: "long-lived",
bypassTagCacheOnCacheHit: true,
}),
// ...
});

// Without regional cache:
export default defineCloudflareConfig({
incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
// ...
});
Queue
A queue must be setup for projects using Time-Based revalidation. It is not needed when revalidation is not used nor only On-Demand revalidation is used.

Configure the queue

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the cache and set up a queue.

The Durable Object Queue will send revalidation requests to a page when needed, and offers support for de-duplicating requests. By default there will be a maximum of 10 instance of the Durables Object Queue and they can each process up to 5 requests in parallel, for up to 50 concurrent ISR revalidations.

// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
// ...
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
// ...
incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
queue: doQueue,
});
You will also need to add some binding to your wrangler.jsonc file.

"durable_objects": {
"bindings": [
{
"name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE",
"class_name": "DOQueueHandler"
}
]
},
"migrations": [
{
"tag": "v1",
"new_sqlite_classes": ["DOQueueHandler"]
}
],
You can customize the behaviors of the queue with environment variables:

The max number of revalidations that can be processed by an instance of durable object at the same time (NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES)
The max time in milliseconds that a revalidation can take before being considered as failed (NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT_MS)
The amount of time after which a revalidation will be attempted again if it failed. If it fails again it will exponentially back off until it reaches the max retry interval (NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS)
The maximum number of attempts that can be made to revalidate a path (NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES)
Disable SQLite for this durable object. It should only be used if your incremental cache is not eventually consistent (NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_DISABLE_SQLITE)
There is 2 additional modes that you can use for the queue direct and the memory queue

The memory queue will dedupe request but only on a per isolate basis. It is not fully suitable for production deployments, you can use it at your own risk!

The direct mode for the queue is intended for debugging purposes and is not recommended for use in production. It only works in preview mode (i.e. wrangler dev)

For apps using the Page Router, res.revalidate requires to provide a self reference service binding named WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE.

In certain situations, you may encounter the limits of what the Durable Object queue can manage for a single page or route. In such cases, you can utilize the queueCache to minimize the number of stale requests sent to the queue. This is achieved by adding and verifying a cache entry via the Cache API before dispatching a request to the queue. If a cache entry already exists, the request will not be sent to the queue, as it will be considered already in process.

// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
// ...
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import queueCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/queue-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
// ...
incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
queue: queueCache(doQueue, {
regionalCacheTtlSec: 5, // The TTL for the regional cache, defaults to 5 seconds

    // Whether to wait for the queue to acknowledge the request before returning
    // When set to false, the cache will be populated asap and the queue will be called after.
    // When set to true, the cache will be populated only after the queue ack is received.
    waitForQueueAck: true,
}),
});
Tag Cache for On-Demand Revalidation
The tag revalidation mechanism can use either a Cloudflare D1 database or Durable Objects with SqliteStorage as its backing store for information about tags, paths, and revalidation times.

To use on-demand revalidation, you should also follow the ISR setup steps.

If your app only uses the pages router, it does not need to have a tag cache and should skip this step. You can also skip this step if your app doesn't use revalidateTag nor revalidatePath.

There are 2 different options to choose from for the tag cache: d1NextTagCache, doShardedTagCache. Which one to choose should be based on two key factors:

Expected Load: Consider the volume of traffic or data you anticipate.
Usage of revalidateTag / revalidatePath: Evaluate how frequently these features will be utilized.
If either of these factors is significant, opting for a sharded database is recommended. Additionally, incorporating a regional cache can further enhance performance.

Create a D1 database and Service Binding

The binding name used in your app's worker is NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1. The WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE service binding should be a self reference to your worker where <WORKER_NAME> is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

// wrangler.jsonc
{
// ...
"d1_databases": [
{
"binding": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1",
"database_id": "<DATABASE_ID>",
"database_name": "<DATABASE_NAME>",
},
],
"services": [
{
"binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
"service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
},
],
}
Create table for tag revalidations

The D1 tag cache requires a revalidations table that tracks On-Demand revalidation times.

Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the R2 cache and set up a queue (see above). The queue will send a revalidation request to a page when needed, but it will not dedupe requests.

// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import d1NextTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/d1-next-tag-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
queue: doQueue,
tagCache: d1NextTagCache,
});
4. Initialise the cache during deployments
   In order for the cache to be properly initialised with the build-time revalidation data, you need to run a command as part of your deploy step. This should be run as part of each deployment to ensure that the cache is being populated with each build's data.

To populate remote bindings and create a new version of your application at the same time, you can use either the deploy command or the upload command. Similarly, the preview command will populate your local bindings and start a Wrangler dev server.

Automatic Cache Purge
You can only enable cache purge functionality on a zone (e.g., when using a custom domain).

The cache purge component automatically clears the cache when a page is revalidated. It is only necessary if you use On-Demand revalidation along with one of the cache components that leverage the Cache API.

This component can either call the Cache API's purge function directly or route the purge request through an intermediate durable object. Using a durable object helps buffer requests and avoid reaching API rate limits.

Cache purge are only called when you call revalidateTag, revalidatePath or res.revalidate in the pages router. It is not called for ISR revalidation.

To use cache purge, you need to define the following wrangler secrets:

CACHE_PURGE_API_TOKEN should be set to an API token with the Cache Purge permission
CACHE_PURGE_ZONE_ID should be set to the zone ID of your deployment domain
Below is an example configuration for integrating the cache purge component in your open-next.config.ts:

import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import { withRegionalCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/regional-cache";
import doShardedTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/do-sharded-tag-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import { purgeCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/cache-purge/index";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
incrementalCache: withRegionalCache(r2IncrementalCache, { mode: "long-lived" }),
queue: doQueue,
// This is only required if you use On-demand revalidation
tagCache: doShardedTagCache({ baseShardSize: 12 }),
// Disable this if you want to use PPR
enableCacheInterception: true,
// you can also use the `durableObject` option to use a durable object as a cache purge
cachePurge: purgeCache({ type: "direct" }),
});
If you want to use the durable object option, you will need to add the following binding to your wrangler.jsonc file:

{
"durable_objects": {
"bindings": [
{
"name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_PURGE",
"class_name": "BucketCachePurge",
},
],
},
"migrations": [
{
"tag": "v1",
"new_sqlite_classes": ["BucketCachePurge"],
},
],
}
You can customize the duration of the cache purge buffering with the NEXT_CACHE_DO_PURGE_BUFFER_TIME_IN_SECONDS environment variable. The default is 5 seconds. It works by buffering the purge requests for a given amount of time and then sending them all at once. This is useful to avoid hitting the API rate limits.

Debugging
You can add NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE=1 to your app .env file to debug any cache issue. The app will output logs whenever the cache is accessed - those logs are generated by both Next and the cache adapter. You can find more details in the Next documentation
